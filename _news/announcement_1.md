I have recently started a postdoctoral position at the University of Luxembourg!

Here's the blurb that the department (ECCS) wanted me to write, but it seems useful to put here:
> Dominic Mussack joined ECCS as a Research Associate (post-doc) in October 2018.
> His research interests focus on using machine learning and cognitive modeling to understand human motivation, decision making, and learning. He is currently working as part of the Xcit lab with Dr Pedro Cardoso-Leite, using data science to improve both digital assessments of student learning and training of executive functions. Dominic studied mathematics and cognitive science at the University of Minnesota, eventually earning a PhD in computational psychology.

The [Xcit lab page](xcit.org/people) has also been updated with my information! It will be updated soon with the new PhD students coming in.

I've only been here since mid-October, but I'm really enjoying both the people and the place. My wife and I have recently moved to Esch-sur-Alzette (a 15-min bus ride to the campus), at a nice apartment, and are adjusting to life in Europe well. This is our first time living out of the States, so it's exciting and challenging. I know almost no French, the dominant language here, but am slowly learning!

I hope to update this website more frequently, which given previous experience isn't too likely. But it's good to have goals!
